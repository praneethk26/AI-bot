vehicle. The same document says that Hermansson is also a partner in Offshore Lease Holdings Limited, which owns the island of Tortola, as well as a holding company, Berwin Property plc. At least one vehicle was associated with Offshore Lease Holdings Ltd. until December 2015.

Foundation of Tor-M2KT 711's ultimate owner: Berwin Property plc (UK)

In 2012, the two directly negotiating parties for theexport of the four S-300 systems to Iran—Road-Map Holding SRL andUCO—were joined by a third entity, Berwin Property plc (BPP), a Cayman Islands holding company owned byMaxim Hermansson of Sweden. BPP would ultimately become the beneficial owner of one of the S-300 launch vehicle vehicles, Tor M2KT 1325, while Road-Map Holding would controlanother vehicle, Tor-M2KT 711. The third vehicle would remain inUCO's name until it was transferred to an United Arab Emirates company called Al Shihlani International Shipping FZE in 2016.

It is not clear how or why BPP was brought into the deal. While UCO may have viewed its involvement as necessary to guarantee additional financing for the S-300s purchase, BPP only had $150 registered in its owner's bank account as of 2013 and so may not have been viewed as bringing substantial financial backing to the deal. Instead, BPP may have been used to hide Hermansson's involvement in the deal from international arms embargo monitors.

In any case, UCO soon transferred ownership of the S-300vehicle to BPP for $16 million on February 28, 2014. Shortly after the transfer, UCO manager Mario Cimino issued a statement to United Nations monitors indicating BPP's role within the transactions. He said that BPP "is subleasing/lending the equipment" to UCO while UCO manages the sale and delivery of equipment to the buyer, a foreign entity that Cimino said could not be disclosed. Cimino added that the buyer was aware of UCO's role in the transaction and had targeted UCO to coordinate the sale due to strong ties between UCO's staff and sellers in Russia. The U.N. monitors confirmed receipt of Cimino's submission and indicated it would be forwarded to the Security Council sanctions committee for review.

Foundation claims BPP is only holding unit for eventual buyer

The next day, BPP director Hermansson told U.N. monitors that BPP would sell the S-300s to an unnamed client for $1 million when it was cleared to do so by the Security Council sanctions committee.

At the time, BPP was already listed in U.N. monitors' documentation for its involvement in other questionable deals involving Iran and North Korea, including an effort to buy U.S. helicopters. A nearly identical scheme had been used to disguise illegal sales of Russian Sukhoi fighter jets to Iran.

In a peculiar coincidence, maxim hermansson is also a partner in Offshore Lease Holdings Limited, a company that owns the island of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. At least one vehicle was associated with Offshore Lease Holdings Ltd. until December 2015.

BPP also distributed payment for the $12 million of S-300s finance via a Singapore holding company called Panavia Asset Management. This sameentity served as a holding company for the Russian helicopters ordered by BPP from China, according to U.N. monitors. That scheme was ultimately exposed and thwarted by the U.N. sanctions committee in 2011, leading to increased scrutiny of Hermansson's companies in following years. Panavia, however, still operates today, responsible for managing assets worth roughly $19 million.

Authorities in Hong Kong then raided a company called Everbright Pacific Shipping. The main purpose of the raid was to retrieve documents related to the supply of Russian military aircraft to Iran on behalf of a company called Shenzhen Eurospeed International Trading Co. Ltd. Shenzhen is a Chinese entity owned by Onyx Consulting Limited, a Cyprus-based company controlled by Hermansson. Onyx consisted of a single employee with no office space, who earned a salary of approximately $35,000 per year. Other than the owner himself and a few legal professionals, the company appears unable to provide evidence of any actual activity. Meanwhile, Hermansson was investigated for illegal arms trafficking in Belgium and France in 2012, though no charges were filed.

Maxim Hermansson is listed as owner of Berwin Property plc, RoadMap Holding SRL, and Klara Investments Limited, all based in the British Virgin Islands. He also served notably as director of two Dutch ships that are believed to be involved in illicit arms shipments in 2007, which targeted Iran and
