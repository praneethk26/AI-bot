RESPONSE:

, good morning," I said immediately, wondering if something was wrong because neither person sounded too chipper.

"Good morning, Rachel. This is Jason from Fertility Clinic of the Rockies."

"Oh, hi," I said. "What's up?"

"It's nothing bad," he assured me. "I was just going over the test results for you and your husband and it looks like you really are completely infertile."

My heart fell through the floor. "What does that mean for IVF?" I asked, my voice quivering.

"What do you mean?" he asked.

"Are we going to get to start treatment next week or not?" I asked. "Is there going to be a delay?"

"There's not a delay," he paused. "You don't have enough money to do anything."

"Excuse me?" I asked. "How much is it?"

"Most couples can only raise about $10,000 online," he said in an apologetic voice. "The only other option is to take out private student loans, which most don't want to do."

I hung up the phone and took a deep breath. I needed to calm down before I started getting dizzy and throwing up on myself. It wasn't anything that guy said. He was totally inexperienced and totally flustered by what was going on. It was the fact that no one had told me this before! Why hadn't I been told that this process was going to cost $10,000?

I looked at the time and saw that Brad was still gone. I picked up my phone and promptly called him.

"Hey, what's up?" he answered cheerfully.

"Did you know that one cycle of IVF costs ten thousand dollars?" I asked angrily.

"Of course I knew," he said. "Don't be ridiculous."

"Why didn't you tell me?" I demanded. "We are not even close to being able to raise that kind of money, and we need to start treatment next week."

"We'll find it," he said. "We're resourceful people."

"What's that supposed to mean?" I asked viciously.

"It means that we are resourceful people," he said in a calm voice. He really seemed to be keeping himself together well for someone who had just witnessed hell first-hand. "We will find the money and we will start the treatment. You'll see. You're just stressing yourself over this."

"I'm not stressing myself," I seethed. "You are." Twenty minutes later, he finally walked into the apartment and I had already showered, dressed and eaten breakfast. His jaw dropped to the ground.

"You showered," he said, stunned. "You look great."

"Well, since I've got fourteen dollars in my bank account, I figured I should just shower at home."

"Oh, I left you some money before I went on the run," he said as he began opening drawers and pulling clothes out. "I left it in an envelope on top of my dresser."

"What am I supposed to do with two hundred dollars?" I asked.

"Get food and stuff," he said. "I figured you could go buy yourself a nice dinner."

"Excuse me?" I asked. "Do you really think that's appropriate in light of the fact that we cannot afford our fertility treatments, which we need to start next week? In light of the fact that we may never have a baby and you don't know when we're going to get our apartment back? What am I supposed to do with two hundred dollars?"

"Wow!" he exclaimed. "What a bitchy thing to say." He was angry now, but I was angrier. "I left you a pittance so you could eat something decent this week and you're giving me all kinds of shit. I spent all night hauling dirt and jump-starting cars for less than minimum wage. I'm in no mood for this."

"Well, I spent all night packing up my life into bags for some monstrous bitch to come in here and throw away, and I'm in no mood for shit, either," I seethed. "And here's something else that I forgot to mention to you. I'm pregnant."

"Don't give me that shit," he snorted. "You have to have intercourse with a man to get pregnant. There's no other way."

"Are you saying that I slept with someone else?" I asked. "Because I'd love to hear it. Is that what you're saying?"

"I wasn't saying that
