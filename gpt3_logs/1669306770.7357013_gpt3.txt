using Deep Learning

Deep learning is a machine learning technique that uses a set of algorithms to model high-level abstractions in data.

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that is based on learning data representations, in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. Deep learning algorithms are able to learn these representations by using a large number of training examples and by using a variety of optimization techniques.
