RESPONSE:

,” Rose went on, “I think you’re really cute. I mean, I don’t think you’re just cute, I think you’re really cute. Like a model cute, like in magazines. Not that I’m into girls like that, but this isn’t about me, it’s about you.

“So, uh, what do you think? You want to go out with me? You want to grab a coffee or get some lunch sometime or something like that?”

Amber squinted at her for a moment before replying. “You’re asking me out on a date?”

“Well, yeah,” Rose said sheepishly. “I mean, you know the definition of ‘date’ and everything, right?”

“Yeah, I know. I’ve heard it. Just never thought anyone would…” She stopped and looked at Rose again. “Yeah, I’d love to go out with you.”

Rose’s heart leaped in her chest as she breathed out a quiet sigh of relief. “Cool. Uh, so, do you have your permissions slip with you?”

Amber grinned. “Mine? Oh, no. I’m not going.”

Rose frowned. “No? Why not? Everyone else is. And it’ll be fun. I promise.”

“It’s not that I don’t want to,” Amber said, “I just can’t. I have to stay here.”

“Oh, well. Too bad. I guess I’ve been wasting my time then. You could have told me sooner,” Rose teased.

“No, no,” Amber said quickly. “I mean, of course I’ll go with you.”

“You will?” Rose asked. It almost sounded too good to be true.

“Yeah. I’ll ask Mr. Carmichael. I’ll bring my slip.”

“Okay, great. Well, I’m going to get some fresh air right now,” Rose said. “Wanna come with me?”

“Sure,” Amber said, getting up from the bench. The two girls walked off together, chatting as though they’d been friends for years.

Meanwhile, Cat sat alone, staring at her arm with a dazed, confused expression on her face. She couldn’t believe it. This was amazing! She had just won the Harvest Dance competitions! Ha!

And then she thought about Tori again. She saved Tori’s life? Cat didn’t know what to think about that. She hadn’t gotten a chance to talk to Tori in a while. Her best estimate was that it had been a few weeks since they’d last seen each other. At a table. Only speaking to each other in order to share some or other sarcastic quip. That wasn’t really how friends spoke. Friends were kind to each other. Friends trusted each other. Friends hung out together. Tori wouldn’t even look at her.

Cat was such an idiot. She was always so sure she knew everything. Clearly, she didn’t know anything at all. How could she have not seen this coming? Tori was going to join the Plastics. Of course she was. She was popular. Cat was… Cat was just Cat. She had no friends. No one liked her. Why would Tori want to be friends with her when she could be friends with the Plastics? Cat and Tori had so little in common, and in school Tori had all her group of friends, and Cat, well, she had no friends. No one.

She could beg Tori to be friends with her. That’s what friends did, right? They had to beg each other to be friends so they could enjoy things together. It was a complex method that required a lot of begging and bartering and pleading, but it was definitely worth it, right? There were times when one friend would do something nice for another, and the other friend would walk all over them. But then the first friend would offer, something and the second friend would agree. In the end, both friends would feel like they’d gotten what they wanted, and the friendship could continue. That was how it worked, right?
