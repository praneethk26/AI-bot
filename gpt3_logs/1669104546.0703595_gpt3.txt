The Indonesian search and rescue agency has confirmed the death of one of its divers who was taking part in the operation to bring home 12 Thai boys and their coach trapped in a flooded cave in Chiang Rai province.

The diver, Muhammad Faizal, 26, is reported to have drowned during a diving operation inside the cave just before midnight.

Faizal had been part of a rescue team of more than 100 people including doctors, police, soldiers and volunteers that was sent from Indonesia to join the operations to rescue the youth football team that had been trapped inside the cave since June 23.

Maj Gen Arif Budiman, head of the rescue team, said that Faizal was leading one of the dive teams when he wanted to surfacing to take a rest along with three other rescuers. "But he was unable to come to the surface. A rescue team came and found him at the bottom of the cave," he said.

Budiman said the latest information indicated that there was an air pocket fourth to seven metres above the bottom of the cave in which Faizal and the other three divers can find rest. But it remains unclear how long the air pocket can last.

Meanwhile, the first rescue mission to bring four of the trapped youths out of the cave began at 1pm (local time) today, according to an announcement by Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn.

The four boys were placed on stretchers and evacuated from the cave through the underground tunnel, according to Narongsak.

He said the four youths are being treated at the hospital in Changhrai. He did not disclose their identities or any further details about the rescue operation.

Two of the boys have pneumothorax, while a third is suffering from hypothermia.
